## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient PYUSD"

**Solution**: 
1. Click "Execute with Pyth Oracle"
2. Approve PYUSD when prompted
3. Wait for confirmation
4. Trade will execute automatically

### "PYUSD transfer failed"
**Problem**: Approval didn't work or insufficient PYUSD
**Solution**:

   - Click "Write Contract"
   - Call `approve(spender, amount)`:
     - `spender`: `0x802405d53f046429D4e76660FFf9E0FE2b3359A5`
     - `amount`: `1000000000` (1000 PYUSD with 6 decimals)

### "Insufficient staked balance"
**Problem**: You're trying to trade more than you staked
**Solution**:
1. Check "Your Staked Balance" in Stake card
2. Reduce trade amount
3. Or stake more ETH first

### App shows old contract address
**Problem**: Browser cache
